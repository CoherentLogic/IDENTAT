# IdentAT

IdentAT is usable only on IBM PC/AT computers (IBM Model 5170).
It will identify whether the computer in question is a Type 1, Type 2, or Type 3,
corresponding to the three motherboard and BIOS revisions that IBM produced.

The source code is compatible with Microsoft Macro Assembler 6.0.

The executable file is IDENTAT.COM, and also provided is a bootable 1.2M 5.25" floppy disk image (IDAT525.IMA). If you use the bootable image, it will automatically run IDENTAT.COM once bootup is complete.
